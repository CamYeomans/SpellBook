# SpellBook
Creating a 5th edition Dungeons and dragons character can be confusing and tedious even for the most experienced of players. Spell Book allows users to quickly set and reset a character's spells without needing to consult the player's handbooks, and it also includes spells from all other published D&D books, such as Xanathar's Guide to Everything.  
Please note that Barbarian is the only class that does not have any spells or casting ability, so you won't be able to use the program for it's spell compendium.
